      <h3 class="dedent">The<br>Beginning <em>by Ellen</em></h3>
      <p>I met Bruce at work and we were just friends for quite some time. When Bruce first asked me out, I was just out of a relationship (as was he), and I wasn't ready to date anyone. So I said no. But I quickly learned that &ldquo;no&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t an option Bruce could get on board with. And due to his incredible persistence &mdash; and maybe just a little bit because he is a wonderful person &mdash; I eventually gave in and he got his date.</p>
      <p>Of course, that was one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve ever made. In hindsight, I realize that from the very beginning I could tell I had met my perfect match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block flip clearfix">
      <h3 class="dedent">Just<br>Knowing <em>by Bruce</em></h3>
      <p>There&rsquo;s something about just knowing that is an extraordinary feeling. Knowing that this person is changing your life forever: that they&rsquo;re the one who makes you the best version of yourself. The one who lets you be the person you always hoped you could be but weren&rsquo;t sure you would be.</p>

      <p>Ellen has always been this person for me. She is the person that brings me to a higher level &mdash; a level of caring, honestly, and balance.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve never been more confident in a decision than I was in chasing Ellen (and I do mean chasing). And, I&rsquo;ve also never been more right in a decision I&rsquo;ve made. She&rsquo;s the best thing that&rsquo;s ever happened to me, and I live every day thankful, and grateful that she accepts and returns the love I have for her.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block clearfix">
      <h3 class="dedent">The<br>Proposal <em>by Bruce</em></h3>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most obvious thing in the world to me.&rdquo; That&lsquo;s how I explained it to her parents when I called them on a sunny afternoon from Civic Center Park in Downtown Denver. &ldquo;I just want the opportunity to make your daughter the happiest person in the world.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly when it happened, there wasn&rsquo;t a moment I decided <em>okay, well, time to get married</em> &mdash; rather, it just felt right. It felt like I always hoped it would. A feeling of happiness and clarity. The feeling of being greatly humbled.</p>

      <p>I asked Ellen to make the most important decision of her life on May 9th 2015 in Longboat Key, Florida.</p>

      <p>At the beach she grew up vacationing on we sat alone together watching the sun disappear behind the water. I told her about the future I hoped we could have together &mdash; and then I asked her if she would marry me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block flip clearfix">
      <h3 class="dedent">Saying<br>Yes <em>by Ellen</em></h3>
      <p>We had never talked about the proposal, we never went ring shopping together. And so he managed to make it a complete surprise.</p>

      <p>I really couldn&rsquo;t have picked a more perfect place for the proposal if I had planned it myself &mdash; at sunset, on the same beach where my grandparents grew old together.</p>

      <p>He didn&rsquo;t tell me it was coming, and kept everything a secret. He had done such a good job being sneaky that even right beforehand, when the thought crossed my mind, I immediately dismissed it.</p>

      <p>We were both sitting on a blanket on the beach watching the sunset, so he made me stand up. And one incredibly sweet speech later I was nodding (and crying) a lot. Apparently, I was so stunned that I forgot to actually say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; right away. It wasn't until I heard him say, &ldquo;so that's a yes, right?&rdquo;, that I realized I needed to verbalize something asap.</p>
